# Threads
Threads is intended to provide support for professionals, too busy living life to worry about what they should wear. The site targets people who want to maximise their freedom of living, and to minimise stress of dressing for it.

In the sign up form, a brochure can be requested with all the details for ordering. This will ensure that marketing can be optimised with carefully targeted campaigns - avoiding information overload for our customers. 

The site is responsive to viewing on mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Please see

#### Main Headings
The logo has been incorporated with the heading in keeping with the product philosophy of having less do more for you.
##### Home Page
The heading has been suggested as an idea (white transparent cloud around text) of looking at your wardrobe and knowing what to wear anytime, anywhere.
![Home Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_home.png)

##### Footer Page
- Links to social meadia are given for the user.  This opens a new tab for easy navigation.

##### Freedom Page
Cross-Over Capsule Clothes explains the hybrid concept of this range giving the user freedom.  The minamilistic idea is promoted in the sense the the user is free to experience life more with less stress of dressing for each occasion.
![Freedom Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom.png)

- Section One
In keeping with the ideas in which way the user will be free to experience life, these sections suggest various scenarios where life can be experienced more with joy wearing the cross-over capsule wardrobe.
![Gallery Heading Section One](assets/images/readme_heading_gallery_freedom_section_1.png)

- Section Two
Here the user has a more spaced out layout to take a moment and savour the experiences with our clothes. Minimalism often promotes buying less.  This site promotes buying to experience more joy from the new items.
![Freedom Page Heading Section Two](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom_section_2.png)

- Section Three
The user is invited to collaborate with us.  The contact details are given next to an image of a smiling modern girls with a huge bunch of lillies.
![Freedom Page Heading Section Three](assets/images/readme_headings_freedome_section_3.png)

##### Gallery Page
The idea that the user can simplify life and enjoy it more is suggested by the images.
- Sign Up for a brochure now! is encapsulated in the white border again to promote the idea of signing up.  Only 3 fields make the task seem small.
![Gallery Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_gallery.png)

##### Signup Page
The signup heading invites the user to take action now by signing up.![Signup Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_signup.png)

### Features Left to Implement

- The gallery page can display the latest products.
- The signup page can be expanded to give an option to have a newsletter subscription.

## Design

### Workflow
At various stages of the project, feedback was gained and changes made to:
- Navigation item Freedom was initially a palette tab. It was recommended that I focus on user experience instead of a sales pitch. I was quote with the idea that if you want someone to sail with you, you need to get them to fall inlove with open waters and not pitch the actual ship tasks to them.
- Navigation item Supportive was initially a measurements tab. Once again, this mundane task was replaced with an almost Steve Jobs pitch of internal as well as external idealism.
- Several refinements had to be made for responsiveness throughout the project, for mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop.  The mobile Galaxy Fold, and the Tablet Mac Air, was used.
- There was a concern that the signup tab form dissappeared behind the white bits of the underlying image. A vote was made by concerned opionators and it was decided to leave it for now.
- Halfway through the project I ran out of Codeanywhere hours and had to switch to Gitpod.  The Code Institute Tutor had me working on Gitpod within a day - so efficient!!
- In response to the peer-review the logo and name of the site was changed from "Cross-over Capsule" to "Threads".

### Tests
#### Solved Bugs
Initially the images were not compressed enough for fast loading.  The image on the 'Supportive'page had to be replaced.  All images are now compressed for faster loading.

#### Chrome Dev Tools Responsive Testing
From the inception of the project all code was written for the mobile (Galaxy Fold), then tested on bigger devices. Media queries were created to ensure that the site is responsive to all 4 devices.

#### AmIResponsive
At the end of the project the final test was done on this [site](assets/images/responsive-results.png).

#### Validator
All HTML and CSS pages were tested.  Most of the bugs found were syntax bugs that were easily resolved.  Errors were thus corrected until there were no errors.

#### Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse
The following scores for mobile were recorded:
![Mobile Home](assets/images/lighthouse_home_mobile.png)
![Mobile Freedom](assets/images/lighthouse_freedom_mobile.png)
![Mobile Supportive](assets/images/lighthouse_supportive_mobile.png)
![Mobile Sign-up](assets/images/lighthouse_signup_mobile.png)

The following scores for desktop were recorded:
![Desktop Home](assets/images/lighthouse_home_desktop.png)
![Desktop Freedom](assets/images/lighthouse_freedom_desktop.png)
![Desktop Supportive](assets/images/lighthouse_supportive_desktop.png)
![Desktop Sign-up](assets/images/lighthouse_signup_desktop.png)

Mention was made in future implementation to review the necessity of a better score, especially for the mobile performance before time is allocated for this.  

#### Features of the site
##### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar links were tested. Hovering and grabbing features are working. The page title is underlined to show which page you have selected. Aria-labels are included in all links.

##### Social Media Links
All social media links in the footer work. Aria-labels are included in all links.

##### Signup Form
The [signup form](assets/images/signup_data_dump.png) data was submitted correctly. [Errors](assets/images/signup_errs.png) messages prevent forms with invalid data being submitted.
