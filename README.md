# Threads - Cross-over Capsule Wardrobe
## User Experience

- An user-centered approach was taken with the design of a lean, simple and elegant site.
- The user should be able to get the lay of the land within a glance.
- The site should be future-proofed to accomodate scalability but keep the navigation of the site consistent for the user - regardless of growth and expansion
- A cautionary note: minimalism is understood to discourage buying activities. The focus for this site to be successful, needs to provide the type of product that brings more joy to the user, than its predecessors and even competitors.
- The image of a smiling woman with lillies was repeated to amplify this focus.

### User Stories UX

#### First Time Visitor Goals
- The visitor is introduced to the idea of going to the wardrobe knowing what to wear anywhere, anytime on the landing page. 
- The site is easy to navigate.  The layout is simple (no decision fatigue or information overload).
- A signup page provides the application for a brochure.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
- Find more information about the company.
- Review new concepts on the Freedom page and new styles on the gallery page.
- Request an updated brochure if the targeted marketing campaign has not sent one yet.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- As the product range and technology expands, new concepts can be loaded on the freedom page.
- New styles and looks can be loaded on the gallery page.
- The visitor should always have options to replace older items with newer items that give more joy.

- - -
## Features

#### Footer Page
- Links to social meadia are given for the user.  This opens a new tab for easy navigation.

#### Main Headings
The logo has been incorporated with the heading in keeping with the product philosophy of having less do more for you.

##### Home Page
The heading has been suggested as an idea (white transparent cloud around text) of looking at your wardrobe and knowing what to wear anytime, anywhere.
![Home Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_home.png)

##### Freedom Page
Cross-Over Capsule Clothes explains the hybrid concept of this range giving the user freedom.  The minamilistic idea is promoted in the sense the the user is free to experience life more with less stress of dressing for each occasion.
![Freedom Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom.png)

- Section One
In keeping with the ideas in which way the user will be free to experience life, these sections suggest various scenarios where life can be experienced more with joy wearing the cross-over capsule wardrobe.
![Gallery Heading Section One](assets/images/readme_heading_gallery_freedom_section_1.png)

- Section Two
Here the user has a more spaced out layout to take a moment and savour the experiences with our clothes. Minimalism often promotes buying less.  This site promotes buying to experience more joy from the new items.
![Freedom Page Heading Section Two](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom_section_2.png)

- Section Three
The user is invited to collaborate with us.  The contact details are given next to an image of a smiling modern girls with a huge bunch of lillies.
![Freedom Page Heading Section Three](assets/images/readme_headings_freedome_section_3.png)

##### Gallery Page
The idea that the user can simplify life and enjoy it more is suggested by the images.
- Sign Up for a brochure now! is encapsulated in the white border again to promote the idea of signing up.  Only 3 fields make the task seem small.
![Gallery Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_gallery.png)
