# Threads
Threads is intended to provide support for professionals, too busy living life to worry about what they should wear. The site targets people who want to maximise their freedom of living, and to minimise the stress of dressing for it.

In the sign up form, a brochure can be requested with all the product information for ordering. This will ensure that marketing can be optimised with carefully targeted campaigns - avoiding information overload for our customers. 

The site is responsive to viewing on mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

# Threads - Cross-over Capsule Wardrobe
## User Experience

- A <b>user-centered</b> approach was taken with the design of a lean, simple and elegant site.
- The user should be able to get the <i><b>lay of the land</i></b> within a glance.
- The site should be <b>future-proofed</b> to accomodate <b>scalability</b> but keep the navigation of the site consistent for the user - regardless of growth and expansion
- A cautionary note: minimalism is understood by some to discourage buying activities. On this site the emphasis should be on replacing items as technology and styles enable them to bring more joy and alleviate stress.
- The image of a smiling woman with lillies was repeated to amplify this focus.

### User Stories UX

#### First Time Visitor Goals
- The visitor is introduced to the idea of going to the wardrobe knowing what to wear anywhere, anytime on the landing page. 
- The site is easy to navigate.  The layout is simple to avoid decision fatigue and information overload.
- An easy-to-use and quick signup page, provides the opportunity for an application of a brochure.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
- Find more information about the company.

- Request an updated brochure.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- Information about new features and technological updates could be found on the Freedom page.

- The visitor should always be encouraged to replace older items with newer items that give more joy.

![Home Page Heading](assets/images/readme_heading_home.png)

##### Freedom Page
Cross-Over Capsule Clothes explains the hybrid concept of this range giving the user freedom.  The minamilistic idea is promoted in the sense the the user is free to experience life more with less stress of dressing for each occasion.

- Section One
In keeping with the ideas in which way the user will be free to experience life, these sections suggest various scenarios where life can be experienced more with joy wearing the cross-over capsule wardrobe.
![Gallery Heading Section One](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom_section_1.png)

- Section Two
Here the user has a more spaced out layout to take a moment and savour the experiences with our clothes. Minimalism often promotes buying less.  This site promotes buying to experience more joy from the new items.
![Freedom Page Heading Section Two](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom_section_2.png)

- Section Three
The user is invited to collaborate with us.  The contact details are given next to an image of a friendly, smiling woman, with a huge bunch of lillies.  This image is repeated on the gallery page to emphasise the concept of <i>living more</i> in our brand of clothing.
![Freedom Page Heading Section Three](assets/images/readme_heading_freedom_section_3%20.png)

##### Gallery Page
The idea that the user can simplify life and enjoy it more is suggested by the images.
